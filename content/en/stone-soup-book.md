This book is a collection of small moments. Moments from a childhood in Korea — quiet, powerful, and formative. The kind of moments that stay with you not because they were dramatic, but because they were true. A four-year-old girl speaks up at the front door, and her father listens. That single act of being heard becomes a gift she carries for a lifetime: the belief that her voice matters, that her thoughts can change the world.

These are the stories of Hari Kim's early life with her father. Each one is brief — a scene, a feeling, a turning point. Together, they form a portrait of how character is shaped in the smallest exchanges between a parent and a child.

The first story is written. It is called *Not Sulah's Mom*.

**Lola**, an artist Hari met in Paris, will create the illustrations for this first story. As her work takes shape, it will appear here — a collaboration unfolding in real time.

This is a Stone Soup project. The book is an open invitation. If you are an illustrator, a visual artist, or someone who sees stories in images — and if these stories move you — you are welcome to contribute. Each story may find its own artist, its own visual language. The book will grow as the collaborators arrive, each bringing their own ingredient to the pot.

What matters is not perfection. What matters is that it is human-made, human-felt, and born from the meeting of different hands and hearts.
