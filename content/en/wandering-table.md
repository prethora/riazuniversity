The idea was born on the road. When you travel, you eat at the mercy of the market. Street stalls and restaurants see you as a transaction. You are hungry, you are passing through, and the food reflects that — quick, functional, forgettable. Over time, this wears on the body and the spirit.

Hari always wished for a different kind of place. Somewhere a wanderer could sit down to a home-cooked meal. Not as a customer, but as a guest. Where the food was prepared with thought — with respect for the ingredients, for the body that would receive them, for the earth from which they came. Where strangers could cook together, eat together, and share stories of where they have been and where they are going.

The Wandering Table is that place. It is a gathering — regular, unhurried, open to whoever arrives. We cook. We sit. We eat. We talk. Not about anything in particular. About whatever needs to be said.

The name is deliberate. The table wanders because the people around it are always changing. Travelers pass through. Locals return. The conversation is never the same twice. But the practice is constant: care for the food, respect for the company, and the quiet understanding that we are all, in one way or another, on our way somewhere.

In a world that is increasingly transactional, the Wandering Table is a refuge. A place where being together is the point.

*The Wandering Table will be a regular gathering at the Riaz University space in Seochon. Details coming soon.*
