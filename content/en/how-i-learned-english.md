Hari Kim is Korean. She learned English on her own as a child, without formal instruction. Today, she speaks with such natural fluency that native speakers cannot place her accent — some think she is American, others British. She is neither. She is someone who found her own way into a language, and in doing so, discovered something about how the human mind learns to move between worlds.

She calls her method **FBI**: Feel, Borrow, Imagine.

**Feel.** When you approach a new language, your greatest obstacle is your logical mind. You want to understand. You want rules, vocabulary lists, grammar tables. But language is not a system to be decoded — it is a world to be felt. Behind every word, every phrase, every expression, there is an intention, an emotion, a texture. A child absorbs language by feeling these textures long before it understands a single rule. The first step is to return to that state. Watch. Listen. Feel the intention before you reach for the meaning.

**Borrow.** Do not translate. This is the trap that keeps most adult learners permanently stuck. When you translate from your own language, you are forcing new wine into old bottles. The structures do not fit, and they never will. Instead, borrow. Take the phrases, the patterns, the frames of the new language exactly as they are. Do not reshape them to fit what you already know. Let them exist on their own terms. You are not converting — you are adopting.

**Imagine.** Once you have felt the emotion and borrowed the frame, place yourself inside it. Imagine situations — many of them, varied, vivid. Use the borrowed frame in each new context. Watch it bend, adapt, become yours. You are not memorizing. You are growing a living thing. Emotion is the soil. The borrowed frame is the seed. Imagination is the water and the sunlight. Given time, a forest grows — and that forest is fluency.

This method is not just about language. It is about how to navigate change. How to let go of fixed identity and move into new territory without clinging to the old. How to become resilient enough that the ground can shift beneath you and you do not fall — because you have learned to walk on shifting ground.

In a world that is changing faster than any curriculum can track, this may be the most important skill there is.

*Hari will share the FBI method at Riaz University. Details coming soon.*
