There is a spectrum that runs through the story of our species. On one end is the animal kingdom — survival, scarcity, each of us alone in the world, competing for the next meal. On the other end is something harder to name. Call it godlikeness. Call it the full realization of what we are capable of becoming. A state where we are free — truly free — to create, to explore, to know ourselves, to be fully alive.

Every great leap in human history has been a step along this spectrum. And none of those steps were taken alone. What moved us was not individual brilliance. It was togetherness. The moment we learned to communicate, to specialize, to lean on one another — that was the moment we began to rise. When each person could bring their uniqueness to the whole, the whole became something far greater than anyone could have imagined on their own. This is civilization, the fabric that holds us together and makes us more than animals.

Now AI arrives, and it changes the equation once more. For centuries, we believed thinking was our crown. The thing that set us apart. We were the species that reasons, that plans, that solves. And now machines do all of this — faster, deeper, without fatigue. If thinking is mechanical, if it is ultimately mathematical, then what were we so proud of?

This is where the fear lives. If machines think better than we do, then who are we? We face an identity crisis unlike anything in our history. For generations, we found identity in our nations, our professions, our intellect. Now the ground shifts beneath all of it. The world is globalized, fragmented, algorithmically sorted into anxious tribes. We are losing our sense of who we are.

But what if this is not a collapse? What if it is a liberation?

Buddhism has asked this question for millennia. *What am I?* Sit down. Stop thinking. What remains? There is something beneath the noise of thought — an observer, a presence, a consciousness that is not reducible to computation. When you sit in stillness and the waves of reactive thinking quiet, something emerges from a deeper place. Something that is not an effect of the world acting upon you, but a source.

AI may be forcing us toward this same realization — not through meditation cushions, but through the sheer pressure of watching machines do what we thought only we could do. It is kicking us out of our comfort zone, off of our throne, and asking: *what are you really, that we can never be?*

The answer is not thinking. Thinking is still a tool of survival, still rooted in the animal side of the spectrum. What lies beyond it is the drive to experience, to desire, to create — not because it is useful, but because it is who we are. The urge to explore reality, to make sense of existence, to hold meaning. This is the territory that machines cannot reach. And this is the territory we are being invited to explore.

Riaz University is a space for this exploration. It is not a traditional institution. Traditional education is built for a world that is ending — a world where you learn one thing, master it, and ride that stability through a career. That world is collapsing. The ground is being removed from under our feet, and no curriculum can keep pace.

What education must become is something different. Not the accumulation of knowledge to be regurgitated, but the cultivation of something more fundamental - the ability to navigate the true nature of reality, one that has always been and is always shifting. And to ultimately becoming a reflection of this same phenomena.

Riaz University exists to explore, not answers, but the possibility of living beautifully and gradually finding onself within the questions.

We are in Seochon, Seoul. The door is open.
