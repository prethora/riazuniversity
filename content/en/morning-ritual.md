Every morning, we cross a threshold. We move from the inner world — sleep, dreams, stillness — into the outer world of action, reaction, and noise.

Most of us make this crossing unconsciously. We wake, we reach for our phones, and within seconds we are swept into the current of the day. The stillness we carried from sleep is gone before we knew it was there.

The Morning Ritual is a practice for making this crossing with care. Sitting. Bowing — 108 bows, a practice rooted in Korean Zen Buddhism. Yoga. Together, these form a bridge between the quiet self and the active self.

This is not about productivity. It is not about optimizing your morning. It is about honoring the fact that you are more than what you do. That the stillness inside you is not a void to be filled, but a source to draw from. When you enter the day from that place, the thinking that follows is less reactive and more your own.

*This practice will be offered at the Riaz University space in Seochon. Details coming soon.*
