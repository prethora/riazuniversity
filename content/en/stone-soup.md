You know the story. A traveler arrives in a village with nothing but a stone. She places it in a pot of water over a fire and begins to cook. The villagers are curious. One by one, they come. One brings a carrot, another an onion, another a handful of herbs. By evening, the pot holds a soup richer than anything any one person could have made alone.

The Stone Soup Project begins with a space. A beautiful room on the ground floor of a building in Seochon, Seoul — quiet, light-filled, overlooking some of the most recognizable landmarks of the city. Right now, the space is like the pot with only the stone and the water. Beautiful in its simplicity. Waiting.

The invitation is open. If you are an artist, a musician, a writer, a maker of any kind — and if this space and this philosophy speak to something in you — you are welcome to come. Bring what you have. Create something here. What you make is yours, but it also becomes part of the whole. A layer added to the soup.

This is not a gallery. It is not a residency in the traditional sense. It is an experiment in what happens when people bring their best selves to a shared space and see what emerges. The beauty of the Stone Soup is that nobody knows what the soup will taste like until everyone has contributed. The whole reveals itself only through the act of coming together.

In the age of AI, this is a deliberate choice. Not a protest against technology, but a celebration of what technology cannot replicate — the unpredictable magic that happens when human beings create in the presence of one another. When individual talent meets collective generosity. When the sum becomes something no one could have computed in advance.

The Stone Soup Project is the creative heartbeat of Riaz University. It is where philosophy becomes something you can touch, taste, hear, and see.

Come add something to the pot.
