What are we, when machines begin to think?

We have always believed that thinking is what makes us human. Now AI mirrors that thinking back to us — faster, tireless, unconstrained. If thinking is computation, and computation can run on silicon, then what remains that is uniquely ours?

While this may seem like a looming crisis, it may be an invitation.

Riaz University is a space for this question. Not a school in any traditional sense — there are no degrees here, no curricula, no exams. The name carries a quiet irony: an institution built to question whether institutions are what we need at all.

What we offer instead is inquiry. Philosophy made practice. The ancient question — *what am I?* — explored not in lecture halls but in shared meals, in morning stillness, in stories told and illustrated by many hands, in the simple and radical act of being fully present with one another.

We are in Seoul, in a quiet corner of Seochon. You are welcome here.
